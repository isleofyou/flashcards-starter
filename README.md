# Abstract

The purpose of this project was to introduce TDD. I created test files for multiple class files and through TDD ensured each class was created correct and without bugs. The end product is a flashcard game that is played in the terminal. A question is given along with multiple choices and the user makes their choice and moves to the next question until none remain. The user is then provided a score.
